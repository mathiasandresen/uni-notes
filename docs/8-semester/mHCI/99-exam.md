-----

**Collect** data:

* **Contextual** Inquiry
  * **Interviews** (deep)
    * **Structured** - almost questionare - Replicable - lacks richness
    * **Semi-structured** - loose script - balance between richness and replicability
    * **Unstructured** - no script - rich - not replicable

      * Accept awkwardness (*pregnant pauses*)
  * **Questionaries** (general)
* **Inspection **- **Observation**
  * **Roles**:
    * **Observer Participant** - fly on the wall
    * **Participant Observer** - field worker is full participant in activities studied
  * [**Technology Tours**](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/pluginfile.php/2233097/mod_resource/content/1/mHCI%20Lecture%202.pdf)
    * **What to Observe**:
      * **Space** - physical space - actors: names and relavant details of people involved
      * **Activities** - what are actors doing and why?
      * **Objects** - physical objects present (eg. furniture) - Acts: specific individual actions
      * **Events** - Observing part of special event?
      * **Time** - Sequence of events
      * **Goals** - Actors trying to accomplish?

**Communicate** idea:

* **Personas**
  * Helps maintain **perspective** of **users**
  * **Fictional** - created based on **research** - **never** of **assumptions**
  * Represent different **user types**
  * Helps understand users’ **needs**, **experiences**, **behaviors** and **goals**.
* **4 types**
    * **Goal oriented**
        * Users' goals - workflow, contexts, attiturdes
        * Based in **in-depth ethnographic research**
        * Provides focused design and communication tool to finish discussions 
    * **Role based**
        * Users roles in organization 
        * **data-driven** - incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative sources
        * efficient design tool - our cognitive ability to use fragmented and incomplete knowledge to form complete vision of people who surround us
    * **Engaging**
        * Designers seeing users as stereotypes -> actively involved in the lives of personas
        * Requires **broad knowledge** of users
            * Data should include information about - social background, psychological characteristics, emotional relationship with the focus area.
    * **Fiction based**
        * To explore and design - generate discussion and insights
        * Based on intuition and experience
        * Creates an empathetic focus in the design process
        * Originate from brainstorming and workshops - participation from company
* **How - 11 steps**
    1. Collect extensive data on target users.
    2. Determine the qualities of and differences between users.
    3. Develop a hypothesis from the research, determining the qualities of and differences between users.
    4. Ensure stakeholders agree on the hypothesis about the users.
    5. Determine a number of personas – more than one per project, but focus *especially* on one
    6. Name and describe each persona in 1-2 pages, including:
        * A picture.
        * (CONTEXT): User’s values, interests, education, lifestyle, needs, attitudes, desires, limitations, goals and behavior patterns.
        * Extra details about the persona (e.g., interests) – anything to make him/her more real and relevant and help build empathy. A written story is better than bullet points.
    7. Describe several situations/scenarios prompting the persona to use your product – put him/her in contexts with problems to overcome.
    8. Include everyone involved in the project so they’ll accept the persona or advise revisions.
    9. Send them the persona to use in their work
    10. Ensure everyone develops scenarios – these should expose the persona optimally to potential use cases
    11. Make continuous adjustments – revisit the persona; add new features; add required new personas; discard outdated personas.

## Question 3

* What is a digital ecosystem? 
  * How can we classify interaction with multiple mobile devices in a digital ecosystem? 

* Give short examples of the four categories of interaction (Collaboration, Communality, Complementarity, Continuity)









## Question 4

* Why is it important for designers know the difference between devices and platforms when we design for them? 
* What is skeuomorphism? 
* How do we ensure that our design will fit into the mobile platform that we design for (e.g., Android, iOS)? 

----



**Different devices and platforms**

* 





**Skeuomorphism**

* Interface objects that mimics their real-world counterparts
    * Recycle bin - floppy disk - toggles - buttons - dials
    * sounds - animations
* Makes users know what they can do with interfaces



**Design Guidelines**

* Follow design guidelines provided by platforms - Apple - Google
* **iPhone** - purpose
    * **Clarity** - Functionality motivates design
    * **Deference** - Content fills the entire screen
    * **Depth** - Go into depth with content
* **iOS** - **guidelines**
    1. **Aesthetic Integrity**
        * How appearance and behavior integrate with its functions
            * Productivity vs Fun/Gaming
    2. **Consistency**
        * Familiar standards and paradigms
            * system provided interface elements
            * well-known icons
            * standard text styles
            * uniform terminology
        * Example: pull down to refresh
    3. **Direct Manipulation**
        * Rotating device - using gestures to affect content
        * Example: pinch to zoom - swiping
    4. **Feedback**
        * acknowledges actions and shows results
        * Example: Shutter sound - vibration
    5. **Metaphors**
        * metaphors for familiar experiences - either rooted in real world or digital world
    6. **User Control**
        * People - not apps - are in control
        * Apps suggest course of action or warn about dangerous consequences

* **Apple watch** - purpose
    * **Lightweight interactions** - short interaction time
    * **Holistic design** - not just on screen interaction
        * "*Holistic design takes into account the person, the device, the moment, the ethnographic environment, the physical space as well as human behavior and psychology*..."
    * **Personal communication** - Meant to be worn
* **watchOS** - guidelines
    1. **Glanceable**
        * Interactions occur over short periods of time
        * apps must convey most important information up front - clearly and without distraction
    2. **Actionable**
        * anticipates user's needs - ensuring onscreen is always current and relavant
        * custom notification interface include custom actions without opening app
    3. **Responsive**
        * interactions should be quick
        * responds to user interaction with immediate feedback
            * what the app is gonna do
        * notifications to deliver progress updates later







## Question 5

* What is a prototype? 
    * When in the design process do, we introduce prototypes? 
    * Give examples of the different prototypes and their strengths and weaknesses.

----

**Prototype**

* simple experimental model of proposed solution
* used to test or validate ideas, design assumptions and other aspects of conceptualization
* cheap and quick

* **Why?**
    * reveal assumptions and biases
    * uncover insights about users
* **Attention points:**
    * **People** - those whom you are testing and observers
    * **Objects** - static and interactive - prototype and objects people and/or prototype interacts with
    * **Location** - places and environments 
    * **Interactions** - Digital or physical - between people, objects and location

**Prototypes - When**

...

**Different Prototypes**

* **Low fidelity**
    * Medium unlike final medium - e.g. paper, cardboard
    * Quick, cheap, easily changed
    * Examples:
        * Sketches of screens
        * task sequences
        * post-its
        * storyboards
        * Wizard of Oz
            * Simulating actual functionality - combine different tools - tablets, email systems, PowerPoint with human intervention
    *
