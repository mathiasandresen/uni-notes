## Procedure

You will receive via Digital Exam an assignment on Jan. 4, for which you have to submit a written solution on Jan. 6. 

Everyone receives a randomly allocated assignment from among these 9 different ones. For each assignment, there will be the option to solve the assignment in one of the two 'modes':

* **Theoretical**
    * Your solution of the assignment consists of explanations, examples, discussion, figures, etc. that are based on the lecture slides and background literature. No Python programming required.
* **Experimental**
    * Your solution will still require some explanations, discussions etc., but is otherwise largely based on implementation and experimentation. Python code developed in the self-study exercises can often be a basis for this type of solution to the assignment.

Obviously, solutions to the assignments must be prepared strictly individually, and no collaboration between students with the same assignments is allowed. Python code developed with other students in the self studies can be freely used, however.
