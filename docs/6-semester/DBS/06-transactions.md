* Understanding the ACID properties
* Understanding the schedule concept
* Understanding serializability
* Understanding recoverable and cascadeless schedules

**Concurrency Control**

* Understand and use lock-based concurrency control
* Understand and use two-phase locking

**Recovery**

* Understanding basic logging algorithms
* Understanding the importance of atomicity and durability



## Transactions

A **transaction** is a collection of operations that forms a **logical unit** of work, during which various data items are accessed and possibly updated.

Transaction boundaries are user-defined!

### ACID Properties

**Atomicity**

* Either all operations of the transaction are properly reflected in the database or none are.
* Often implemented via logs

**Consistency**

* Execution of a transaction in isolation preserves the consistency of the database.
* According to constraints, checks, assertions
* In addition, consistency is defined by the application, e.g., fund transfers should not generate or destroy money – the overall sum is the same before and afterwards

**Isolation**

* Each transaction appears to have the DB exclusively on its own.
* Intermediate results must be hidden for other transactions.
* Often implemented via locks

**Durability**

* Updates of successfully completed transactions must not get lost despite system failures
* Often implemented via logs



### Operations on Transactions

* `BEGIN` 
    * Starts a transaction
* `COMMIT`
    * Ends a transaction
* `ROLLBACK`
    * All changes are undone/discarded

**SAVEPOINT**

* `SAVEPOINT <savepoint_name>;`
    * Defines a point/state within a transaction
    * A transaction can be **rolled back partially** back up to the savepoint
* `ROLLBACK TO <savepoint_name>`
    * Rolls the active transaction back to the savepoint `<savepoint_name>`

### Transaction States

### How do DBMSs Support Transactions?

The two most important components of transaction management are:

**Multi-user Synchronization (isolation)**

* Semantic correctness despite concurrency 
    Concurrency allows for high throughput
* Serializability
* Weaker isolation levels

**Recovery (atomicity and durability)**

* Roll back partially executed transactions
* Re-executing transactions after failures
* Guaranteeing persistence of transactional updates





## Schedules and Serializability

### Concurrency

Affects the **I** in **ACID**

**Problems**

* **Lost Updates**
    * Overwriting updates
    * ![image-20200320095006994](images/06-transactions/image-20200320095006994.png)
* **Dirty Read**
    * Dependency on non-committed updates
    * ![image-20200320095036965](images/06-transactions/image-20200320095036965.png)
* **Non-repeatable Read**
    * Dependency on other updates
    * T2 loses the illusion that it is alone in the database
    * ![image-20200320095144395](images/06-transactions/image-20200320095144395.png)
* **Phantom Problem**
    * Dependency on new/deleted tuples
    * ![image-20200320095310588](images/06-transactions/image-20200320095310588.png)



### Schedules

A **schedule** is a **sequence of operations** from one ore more transactions.
For concurrent transactions, the operations are interleaved.

**Operations**

* `read(Q,q)`
    * Read the value of database item Q and store it in the local variable q.
* `write(Q,q)`
    * Store the value of the local variable q in the database item Q
* Arithmetic operations
* `commit`
* `abort`



**Serial Schedule**
The operations of the transactions are executed sequentially with no overlap in time

**Concurrent Schedule**
The operations of the transactions are executed with overlap in time

**Valid Schedule**
A schedule is valid if the result of its executions is "correct"



#### Example Schedules

![image-20200320100146715](images/06-transactions/image-20200320100146715.png)



#### Correctness

**Definition 1 (D1)**
A concurrent execution of transactions must leave the database in a consistent state

**Definition 2 (D2)**
Concurrent execution of transactions must be (result) equivalent to some serial execution of the transactions

* We use **Definition 2**



**Simplifying assumptions**

* **Only reads and writes** are used to determine correctness
* This assumption is stronger than definition D2, as even fewer schedules are considered correct. 



#### Conflicts

**Definition 4 (D4)**[^1]

A schedule is **conflict serializable** if it is **conflict equivalent** to <u>a</u> serial schedule

* It ensures that after execution the database is in a consistent state.

[^1]: Third definition D3 is view serializability, and is not covered in the course

**Alternative Definition from Web**

A schedule is called **conflict serializable** if it can be transformed into a **serial** schedule by **swapping non-conflicting operations.**




There is a conflict if there is a read and a write on the same data unit. Also if there is a write on the same data unit.

![image-20200320101311773](images/06-transactions/image-20200320101311773.png)



Let I and J be consecutive instructions of a schedule S of multiple transactions

* If I and J do not conflict, we can swap their order to produce a new schedule S'

* The instructions appear in the same order in S and S', except for I and J, whose order does not matter

* S and S' are termed **conflict equivalent schedules**



#### Examples

![image-20200320101628433](images/06-transactions/image-20200320101628433.png)



![image-20200320101942077](images/06-transactions/image-20200320101942077.png)



#### Conflict Graph

AKA **Precedence graph**



Directed graph

**Assumption**:

* A transaction will always read an item before it writes that item



Given a schedule for a set of transactions $T_1,T_2,\dots,T_n$

* The vertices of the conflict graph are the transactions identifiers
* An edge from $T_i$ to $T_j$ denotes that the two transactions are conflicting, with $T_i$ making the relevant access earlier
* Sometimes the edge is labeled with the item involved in the conflict





#### Draw a Conflict Graph

1. For each transaction $T_x$ participating in schedule $S$, create a node labeled $T_i$ in the precedence graph. 
2. For each case in $S$ where $T_j$ executes a `read(X)` **after** $T_i$ executes a `write(X)`, create an edge ($T_i \to T_j$) in the precedence graph. 
3. For each case in $S$ where $T_j$ executes a `write(X)` **after** $T_i$ executes a `read(X)`, create an edge ($T_i \to T_j$) in the precedence graph.
4. For each case in S where $T_j$ executes a `write(X)` **after** $T_i$ executes a `write(X)`, create an edge ($T_i \to T_j$) in the precedence graph.



#### Determining Serializability

Given a schedule S and a conflict graph

* A schedule is **conflict serializable** if its conflict graph is **acyclic** (**no cycles**)
* Intuitively, a conflict between two transactions forces an execution order between them (topological sorting)



##### Example

![image-20200320102532105](images/06-transactions/image-20200320102532105.png)



Which of the following are conflict serial schedules?

![image-20200529113653558](images/06-transactions/image-20200529113653558.png)







#### Relationship Among Schedules

![image-20200320102749551](images/06-transactions/image-20200320102749551.png)



### Recoverable and Cascadeless Schedules

**Transactions can fail!**

* If $T_i$ fails, it must be rolled back to retain the **atomicity** property of transactions

* If another transaction $T_j$ has read a data item written by $T_i$, then $T_j$ must also be rolled back

    $\Rightarrow$ database systems must ensure that schedules are recoverable

This schedule is not recoverable:

![image-20200529113950922](images/06-transactions/image-20200529113950922.png)





#### Recoverable

A schedule is **recoverable** if for each pair of transactions $T_i$ and $T_j$ 
	where $T_j$ reads data items written by  $T_i$, 
	then $T_i$ must **commit** before $T_j$ **commits**.



![image-20200320103122260](images/06-transactions/image-20200320103122260.png)



#### Cascadeless

A schedule is **cascadeless** if for each pair of transactions $T_i$ and $T_j$, 
	where $T_j$ reads data items written by $T_i$, 
	the **commit** operation of $T_i$ must appear before the **read** by $T_j$ 

* In other words, if you only read committed data
* Every cascadeless schedule is also recoverable.



Cascading rollbacks can easily become expensive.

It is desirable to restrict the schedules to those that are cascadeless.



## Concurrency Control

### Scheduler

![image-20200529114519755](images/06-transactions/image-20200529114519755.png)

Task of the scheduler:

* produce serializable schedules of instructions (transactions $T_1, \dots, T_n$) that avoid cascading rollbacks

Realized by **synchronization** strategies

* pessimistic
    * lock-based synchronization
    * timestamp-based synchronization
* optimistic



### Lock-based Synchronization

**Ensuring (conflict) serializable schedules** by **delaying** transactions that could violate serializability.

Two types of locks can be held on a data item Q

* S (shared, read lock)
* X (exclusive, write lock)

Operations on locks:

* `lock_S(Q)`
    * set shared lock on data item Q
* `lock_X(Q)`
    * set exclusive lock on data item Q
* `unlock(Q)`
    * release lock on data item Q



#### Lock Privileges

A transaction holding

* an exclusive lock may issue a write or read access request on the item
* a shared lock may issue a read access request on the item

**Compatibility Matrix**

![image-20200529114819205](images/06-transactions/image-20200529114819205.png)

NL - no lock



* Concurrent transactions can only be granted compatible locks
* A transaction might have to wait until a requested lock can be granted!



#### Problems with Early Unlocking

**Early unlocking** can cause **incorrect** results (non-serializable schedules) but allows for a higher degree of concurrency.

![image-20200529115015298](images/06-transactions/image-20200529115015298.png)

* Initially A = 100 and B = 200
* serial schedule $T_{15};T_{16}$ prints 300
* serial schedule $T_{16};T_{15}$ prints 300
* $S_7$ prints 250



#### Problems with Late Unlocking

Late unlocking avoids non-serializable schedules. But it increases the chances of **deadlocks**.

Learn to live with it!

![image-20200529115221255](images/06-transactions/image-20200529115221255.png)





### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

Is a protocol

* First phase (growing phase):
    * Transactions **may request** locks
    * Transactions **may not release** locks
* Second phase (shrinking phase):
    * Transactions **may not** **request** locks
    * Transactions **may release** locks



![image-20200330083508346](images/06-transactions/image-20200330083508346.png)

When the first lock is release, the we move from first to second phase.



#### Examples

Remember that we look at transactions **indi**

![image-20200330083658288](images/06-transactions/image-20200330083658288.png)

#### Characteristics of 2PL

* Produces only serializable schedules
    * Insures conflict serializability
    * Produces a subset of all possible serializable schedules
* Does **not** prevent deadlocks
* Does **not** prevent cascading rollbacks
    * "Dirty" reads are possible (reading from non-committed transactions)



#### Variations of 2PL

**Strict 2PL**

* **Exclusive** locks are not released before the transaction commits
* Prevents "dirty reads"

**Rigorous 2PL**

* **All** locks are released after commit time
* Transactions can be serialized in the order they commit



**Advantage**

* No cascading rollbacks

**Disadvantage**

* Loss of potential concurrency

![image-20200330084351622](images/06-transactions/image-20200330084351622.png)



### Lock Conversion

**Goal:** apply 2PL but allow for a higher degree of concurrency

**First phase**

* Acquire an S-lock on a data item
* Acquire an X-lock on a data item
* Convert (upgrade) an S-lock to an X-lock

**Second phase**

* Release S-, and X-locks
* Convert (downgrade) an X-lock to an S-lock



This protocol still ensures serializability. 
It relies on the application programmer to insert the appropriate locks.

### Overview

![image-20200330084840603](images/06-transactions/image-20200330084840603.png)



### Deadlocks

![image-20200330084946125](images/06-transactions/image-20200330084946125.png)

**Solutions**

* detection and recovery
* prevention
* *timeout* (not covered in presentation)



#### Deadlock Detection

Create a "**Wait-for graph**" and check for cycles

* One node for each active transaction $T_i$
* Edge $T_i\to T_j$ if $T_i$ waits for the release of locks by $T_j$

*A deadlock exists if the wait-for graph has a cycle*



If a deadlock is detected:

* Select an appropriate victim
* Abort the victim and release its locks



##### Example

![image-20200330085413521](images/06-transactions/image-20200330085413521.png)



##### Rollback Candidates

Choosing a good victim transaction



Rollback of one or more transactions that are involved in the cycle

* **The latest** (minimization of rollback effort)
* **The one holding the most locks** (maximization of released resources)



Prevent that always the same victim is chosen (starvation)

* **"rollback counter"**
    * if above a certain threshold: no more rollbacks to break deadlocks



#### Deadlock Prevention

**Conservative 2PL**

* 2PL as well as strict and rigorous 2PL do not prevent deadlocks
* Additional requirement:
    * All locks (shared and exclusive) are obtained right in the beginning of a transaction

![image-20200330085847379](images/06-transactions/image-20200330085847379.png)



### Summary: Concurrency Control

* Many concurrency control protocols have been developed
    *  Main goal: allowing only serializable, recoverable and cascadeless schedules
    * Two-phase locking (2PL)
        * Most relational DBMS's use rigorous two-phase locking
* Deadlock detection (wait-for graph) and prevention (conservative 2PL)
* Serializability vs. concurrency





## Recovery

"Problems" with transactions

* Atomicity
    * Transactions may abort (rollback)
* Durability
    * What if a DBMS crashes?

The role of the **recovery** component is to ensure atomicity and durability of transactions in the presence of system failures.



### Durability

[How can durability be guaranteed (DBS6 Slides p. 159)](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/pluginfile.php/1987452/mod_resource/content/1/DBS-transactions.pdf#159)

Durability is **relative** and depends on the number of copies and the geographical location

Guarantees only possible if

* we first update the copies and
* notify the user afterwards that a transaction's commit was successful

We hence assume that the **WAL (Write Ahead Logging)** rule is satisfied



**Variations of applying the WAL rule:**

* **Log-based recovery**
* Full redundancy:  mirroring/shadowing all data on multiple computers (disks, computing centers) that redundantly do the same
    * Not covered in course



### Failure Classification

**Transaction failure** (failure of a not yet committed transaction)

* Undo the changes of the transaction

**System crash** (failure with main memory loss)

* Changes of committed transactions must be preserved
* Changes of all non-committed transactions need to be undone

**Disk failure** (failure with hard disk loss)

* Recovery based on archives/dumps



### Data Storage

Two-level storage hierarchy

 Data is organized in pages and blocks

![image-20200330091945727](images/06-transactions/image-20200330091945727.png)

* **Volatile storage** (main memory buffer)
* **Non-volatile storage** (hard disk)
* Stable storage (RAIDS, remote backups, ... )
    * not covered in course



#### Movement of Values

![image-20200330092127877](images/06-transactions/image-20200330092127877.png)



#### Storage Operations

Transactions access and update the database

* Operations for moving blocks with data items between disk and main memory (system buffer)
    * **Input(Q)**
        * Transfer block containing data item Q to main memory
    * **Output(Q)**
        * Transfer block containing Q to disk and replace
* Operations for moving values between data items and application variables
    * **read(Q,q)**
        * Assign the value of data item Q to variable q
    * **write(Q,q)**
        * Assign the value of variable q to data item Q



### Logging

**WAL (Write Ahead Logging)**

* Before a transaction enters the **commit** state, “all its” log entries have to be written to stable storage, including the commit log entry
* Before a modified page (or block) in main memory can be written to the database (non-volatile storage), “all its” log entries have to be written to stable storage



During normal operation

* When starting, a transaction $T$ registers itself in the **log**: [T start]

* When modifying data item X by write(X,x)

    1. Add log entry with
        * [$T$, X, V-old, V-new]
            * $T$: transaction's ID
            * X: data item name
            * old value of item
            * new value of item
    2. Write the new value of X

    *The buffer manager asynchronously outputs the value to disk later*

* When finishing, a transaction $T$ appends [T commit] to the log, $T$ then commits

    *The transaction commits precisely when the commit entry (after all previous entries for this transaction) is output to the log!*



#### Log Entries

Structure of a log entry (log record)

<center><code>[TID. DID. old, new]</code></center>

* `TID`
    * identifier of the transaction that caused the update
* `DID`
    * data item identifier
        location on disk (page, block, offset)
* `old`
    * value of the data item before the update
* `new`
    * value of the data item after the update

Additional entries

* `start`
    * `[TID start]`
    * Transaction TID has started
* `commit`
    * `[TID commit]`
    * Transaction TID has committed
* `abort`
    * `[TID abort]`
    * Transaction TID has aborted



#### Example

### Log-based Recovery

Operations to recover from failures

* **Redo**: perform the changes to the database again
* **Undo**: restore database to state prior to execution



![image-20200330094014994](images/06-transactions/image-20200330094014994.png)



#### Recovery Algorithm

To recover from a failure

* Reproduce (**redo**) results for committed transactions
* **Undo** changes of transactions that did not commit

Remarks

* In a multitasking system, more than one transaction may need to be undone.
* If a system crashes during the recovery stage, the new recovery must still give correct results (**idempotence**).



#### Phases of Recovery

1. Redo (repeat history)
    * Forward scan through the log
    * Repeat **all** updates in the same order as in the log file
    * Determine "undo" transactions
        * [$T_i$ start] add $T_i$ to the "undo list"
        * [$T_i$ abort] or [$T_i$ commit] remove $T_i$ from the "undo list"
2. Undo (rollback) all transactions in the "undo list"
    * Backwards scan through the log
    * Undo all updates of transactions in the "undo list"
        * create a compensating log record
    * For a [$T_i$ start] record of a transaction $T_i$ in the "undo list", add a [$T_i$ abort] record to the log file, remove $T_i$ from the "undo list"
    * Stop when "undo list" is empty



#### Compensating Log Records

`[TID, DID, value]`

* Created to undo (compensate) the changes of `[TID, DID, value, newValue]`
* Redo-only log record
* Can also be used to rollback a transaction during normal o
