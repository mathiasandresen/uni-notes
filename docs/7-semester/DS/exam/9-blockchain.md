## Question 9 - Blockchain (Tamper-free linked lists, Nakamoto Consensus, proof of work, transactions in Merkle trees)

* Explain the characteristics of the blocks in a blockchain (e.g.: immutability, linear growth)
* Explain how the crypto tools used in blockchain work (hash function, signature, merkle tree, hash pointer) and how they are used in the blockchain
* Explain why Paxos consensus is not enough for a blockchain, e.g.: to protect against the double spending conundrum
* Bitcoin: explain the structure of the transaction and how they are verified by the miner
