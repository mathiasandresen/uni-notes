## Question 1

* How can we define and characterize mobile computing? 
  * Give examples of the different eras. 

* What is context and why is important for mobile computing? 
  * What is Big C and Small C? 
  * How can we communicate context to others?



## Question 2

* How can we collect data about the context of our idea? 
  * Give examples of the different ways of communicating your idea to other team members/costumers/users?

-----

**Collect** data:

* **Contextual** Inquiry
  * **Interviews** (deep)
    * **Structured** - almost questionare - Replicable - lacks richness
    * **Semi-structured** - loose script - balance between richness and replicability
    * **Unstructured** - no script - rich - not replicable
    * **Focus groups** - group interview
    * 
    * **Interview tips**
      * Open questions
      * Avoid Leading questions that make assumptions
      * Learn the participants language
      * Use probe questions
        * *Tell me more about...You said “desperate.” What do you mean by that?*
      * Accept awkwardness (*pregnant pauses*)
  * **Questionaries** (general)
* **Inspection **- **Observation**
  * **Roles**:
    * **Observer Participant** - fly on the wall
    * **Participant Observer** - field worker is full participant in activities studied
  * [**Technology Tours**](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/pluginfile.php/2233097/mod_resource/content/1/mHCI%20Lecture%202.pdf)
    * **What to Observe**:
      * **Space** - physical space - actors: names and relavant details of people involved
      * **Activities** - what are actors doing and why?
      * **Objects** - physical objects present (eg. furniture) - Acts: specific individual actions
      * **Events** - Observing part of special event?
      * **Time** - Sequence of events
      * **Goals** - Actors trying to accomplish?
      * **Feelings** - Mood of group and individuals
* **The challenge** - *what people **say** and what they **do** are **not** the same.*
  * **Combine** interview and observation - **triangulation**



**Communicate** idea:

* **Personas**
  * Helps maintain **perspective** of **users**
  * **Fictional** - created based on **research** - **never** of **assumptions**
  * Represent different **user types**
  * Helps understand users’ **needs**, **experiences**, **behaviors** and **goals**.
* **4 types**
    * **Goal oriented**
        * Users' goals - workflow, contexts, attiturdes
        * Based in **in-depth ethnographic research**
        * Provides focused design and communication tool to finish discussions 
    * **Role based**
        * Users roles in organization 
        * **data-driven** - incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative sources
        * efficient design tool - our cognitive ability to use fragmented and incomplete knowledge to form complete vision of people who surround us
    * **Engaging**
        * Designers seeing users as stereotypes -> actively involved in the lives of personas
        * Requires **broad knowledge** of users
            * Data should include information about - social background, psychological characteristics, emotional relationship with the focus area.
    * **Fiction based**
        * To explore and design - generate discussion and insights
        * Based on intuition and experience
        * Creates an empathetic focus in the design process
        * Originate from brainstorming and workshops - participation from company
* **How - 11 steps**
    1. Collect extensive data on target users.
    2. Determine the qualities of and differences between users.
    3. Develop a hypothesis from the research, determining the qualities of and differences between users.
    4. Ensure stakeholders agree on the hypothesis about the users.
    5. Determine a number of personas – more than one per project, but focus *especially* on one
    6. Name and describe each persona in 1-2 pages, including:
        * A picture.
        * (CONTEXT): User’s values, interests, education, lifestyle, needs, attitudes, desires, limitations, goals and behavior patterns.
        * Extra details about the persona (e.g., interests) – anything to make him/her more real and relevant and help build empathy. A written story is better than bullet points.
    7. Describe several situations/scenarios prompting the persona to use your product – put him/her in contexts with problems to overcome.
    8. Include everyone involved in the project so they’ll accept the persona or advise revisions.
    9. Send them the persona to use in their work
    10. Ensure everyone develops scenarios – these should expose the persona optimally to potential use cases
    11. Make continuous adjustments – revisit the persona; add new features; add required new personas; discard outdated personas.

## Question 3

* What is a digital ecosystem? 
  * How can we classify interaction with multiple mobile devices in a digital ecosystem? 

* Give short examples of the four categories of interaction (Collaboration, Communality, Complementarity, Continuity)



## Question 4

* Why is it important for designers know the difference between devices and platforms when we design for them? 
* What is skeuomorphism? 
* How do we ensure that our design will fit into the mobile platform that we design for (e.g., Android, iOS)?
